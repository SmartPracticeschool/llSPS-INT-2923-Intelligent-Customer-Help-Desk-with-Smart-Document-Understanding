# llSPS-INT-2923-Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding


1. Project Scope, Schedule, Team & Deliverables
 
Project Summary

A chatbot is created which has the capability to answer different sets of queries asked by the customers. Using the Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding (SDU) feature, we will enhance the Discovery model so that queries will be better focused to only search the most relevant information found in a typical owner's manual. 
BThe benefits of this kind of chatbot is that it is superior than the typical chatbot which can answers simple questions like store location and hours. The chatbot is upgraded with the help of watson discovery collection which is build using smart document understanding.
If the customer question is about the operation of a device, we will use the webhook feature of Watson Assistant to pass the question onto our Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the deviceâ€™s owners manual.
